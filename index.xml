      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get together along with the group of people already united around https://github.com/opensourcecities/montreal to share some ideas and start interesting open source related discussions :)

We&amp;rsquo;ll have 2 presentations to be announced soon (will update this description as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s confirmed) but the most important thing is to get there and finally meet this amazing group of people and help decide what direction do we want to take with this meetup.</description>
