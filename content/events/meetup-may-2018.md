Let's get together along with the group of people already united around https://github.com/opensourcecities/montreal to
share some ideas and start interesting open source related discussions :)

This month we'll have Vincent Cloutier sharing his experience working on ipfs.pics:

> ipfs.pics is getting reborn! ipfs.pics is an open-source photo sharing system with undeletable pictures (think of it
as the anti-snapchat), that became quite large before overwhelming its creators with stars (900 stars on github), memes
(russian), and porn (obviously). Its makers shut it down, but plans to keep things manageable have been devised. Lessons
learned by managing a large community of users and developers will be shared, as well as things its creators wished they
had known beforehand.

After this talk, we plan to have three lightning talks - five minutes each - about open source project's YOU are working
on. If you'd like to talk briefly about your project, GET IN TOUCH!
